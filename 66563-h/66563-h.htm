<p>My object in publishing the “Red Man’s Rebuke” on the bark of the white birch
tree, is out of loyalty to my own people, and gratitude to the Great Spirit, who in his
wisdom provided for our use for untold generations, this most remarkable tree with
manifold bark used by us instead of paper, being of greater value to us as it could
not be injured by sun or water.</p>

<p>Out of the bark of this wonderful tree were made hats, caps, and dishes for domestic
use, while our maidens tied with it the knot that sealed their marriage vow;
wigwams were made of it, as well as large canoes that outrode the violent storms on
lake and sea; it was also used for light and fuel at our war councils and spirit dances.
Originally the shore of our northern lakes and streams were fringed with it and evergreen,
and the white charmingly contrasted with the green mirrored from the water
was indeed beautiful, but like the red man this tree is vanishing from our forests.</p>

<p>In behalf of my people, the American Indians, I hereby declare to you,
the pale-faced race that has usurped our lands and homes, that we have no
spirit to celebrate with you the Great Columbian Fair now being held in this
Chicago city, the wonder of the world.</p>

<p>No; sooner would we hold high joy-day over the graves of our departed
fathers, than to celebrate our own funeral, the discovery of America. And
while you who are strangers, and you who live here, bring the offerings of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_2"></a>[2]</span>
handiwork of your own lands, and your hearts in admiration rejoice over the
beauty and grandeur of this young republic, and you say, “Behold the wonders
wrought by our children in this foreign land,” do not forget that this
success has been at the sacrifice of <em>our</em> homes and a once happy race.</p>

<p>Where these great Columbian show-buildings stretch skyward, and where
stands this “Queen City of the West,” <em>once</em> stood the red man’s wigwam;
here met their old men, young men, and maidens; here blazed their council-fires.
But now the eagle’s eye can find no trace of them. Here was the center of
their wide-spread hunting-grounds; stretching far eastward, and to the great
salt Gulf southward, and to the lofty Rocky Mountain chain westward; and all
about and beyond the Great Lakes northward roamed vast herds of buffalo
that no man could number, while moose, deer, and elk were found from
ocean to ocean; pigeons, ducks, and geese in near bow-shot moved in great
clouds through the air, while fish swarmed our streams, lakes, and seas close
to shore. All were provided by the Great Spirit for our use; we destroyed
none except for food and dress; had plenty and were contented and happy.</p>

<p>But alas! the pale-faces came by chance to our shores, many times very
needy and hungry. We nursed and fed them,—fed the ravens that were soon
to pluck out our eyes, and the eyes of our children; for no sooner had the
news reached the Old World that a new continent had been found, peopled<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_3"></a>[3]</span>
with another race of men, than, locust-like, they swarmed on all our coasts;
and, like the carrion crows in spring, that in circles wheel and clamor long and
loud, and will not cease until they find and feast upon the dead, so these
strangers from the East long circuits made, and turkey-like they gobbled in
our ears, “Give us gold, give us gold;” “Where find you gold? Where find
you gold?”</p>

<p>We gave for promises and “gewgaws” all the gold we had, and showed
them where to dig for more; to repay us, they robbed our homes of fathers,
mothers, sons, and daughters; some were forced across the sea for
slaves in Spain, while multitudes were dragged into the mines to dig for
gold, and held in slavery there until all who escaped not, died under the
lash of the cruel task-master. It finally passed into their history that, “the
red man of the West, unlike the black man of the East, will die before he’ll
be a slave.” Our hearts were crushed by such base ingratitude; and, as the
United States has now decreed, “No Chinaman shall land on our shores,”
so we then felt that no such barbarians as they, should land on <em>ours</em>.</p>

<p>In those days that tried our fathers’ souls, tradition says: “A crippled,
grey-haired sire told his tribe that in the visions of the night he was lifted high
above the earth, and in great wonder beheld a vast spider-web spread out over
the land from the Atlantic Ocean toward the setting sun. Its net-work was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_4"></a>[4]</span>
made of rods of iron; along its lines in all directions rushed monstrous spiders,
greater in strength, and larger far than any beast of earth, clad in brass and
iron, dragging after them long rows of wigwams with families therein, out-stripping
in their course the flight of birds that fled before them. Hissing
from their nostrils came forth fire and smoke, striking terror to both fowl and
beast. The red men hid themselves in fear, or fled away, while the white men
trained these monsters for the war path, as warriors for battle.”</p>

<p>The old man who saw the vision claimed it meant that the Indian race
would surely pass away before the pale-faced strangers. He died a
martyr to his belief. Centuries have passed since that time, and we now behold
in the vision as in a mirror, the present net-work of railroads, and the
monstrous engines with their fire, smoke, and hissing steam, with cars attached,
as they go sweeping through the land.</p>

<p>The cyclone of civilization rolled westward; the forests of untold centuries
were swept away; streams dried up; lakes fell back from their ancient
bounds; and all our fathers once loved to gaze upon was destroyed, defaced,
or marred, except the sun, moon, and starry skies above, which the Great
Spirit in his wisdom hung beyond their reach.</p>

<p>Still on the storm-cloud rolled, while before its lightning and thunder the
beasts of the field and the fowls of the air withered like grass before the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_5"></a>[5]</span>
flame—were shot for love of power to kill alone, and left to spoil upon the
plains. Their bleaching bones now scattered far and near, in shame declare
the wanton cruelty of pale-faced men. The storm unsatisfied on land swept
our lakes and streams, while before its clouds of hooks, nets, and glistening
spears the fish vanished from our waters like the morning dew before the
rising sun. Thus our inheritance was cut off, and we were driven and scattered
as sheep before the wolves.</p>

<p>Nor was this all. They brought among us fatal diseases our fathers knew
not of; our medicine-men tried in vain to check the deadly plague; but they
themselves died, and our people fell as fall the leaves before the autumn’s
blast. To be just, we must acknowledge there were some good men with these
strangers, who gave their lives for ours, and in great kindness taught us the
revealed will of the Great Spirit through his Son Jesus, the mediator between
God and man. But while we were being taught to love the Lord our God with
all our heart, mind, and strength, and our neighbors as ourselves, and our children
were taught to lisp, “Our Father who art in heaven, hallowed be thy
name,” bad men of the same race, whom we thought of the same belief,
shocked our faith in the revealed will of the Father, as they came among us
with bitter oaths upon their lips, something we had never heard before, and
cups of “fire-water” in their hands, something we had never seen before.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_6"></a>[6]</span>
They pressed the sparkling glasses to our lips and said, “Drink, and you will be
happy.” We drank thereof, we and our children, but alas! like the serpent
that charms to kill, the drink-habit coiled about the heart-strings of its victims,
shocking onto death, friendship, love, honor, manhood—all that makes men
good and noble; crushing out all ambition, and leaving naught but a culprit
vagabond in the place of a man.</p>

<p>Now as we have been taught to believe that our first parents ate of the forbidden
fruit, and fell, so we as fully believe this fire-water is the hard-cider
of the white man’s devil, made from the fruit of that tree that brought
death into the world, and all our woes. The arrow, the scalping-knife, and
the tomahawk used on the war-path were <em>merciful</em> compared with it; <em>they</em>
were used in our defense, but the accursed drink came like the serpent in the
form of a dove. Many of our people partook of it without mistrust, as
children pluck the flowers and clutch a scorpion in their grasp; only when
they feel the sting, they let the flowers fall. But Nature’s children had no
such power; for when the viper’s fangs they felt, they only hugged the reptile
the more closely to their breasts, while friends before them stood pleading
with prayers and tears that they would let the deadly serpent drop. But all
in vain. Although they promised so to do, yet with laughing grin and steps
uncertain like the fool, they still more frequently guzzled down this hellish<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_7"></a>[7]</span>
drug. Finally conscience ceased to give alarm, and, led by deep despair to
life’s last brink, and goaded by demons on every side, they cursed themselves,
they cursed their friends, they cursed their beggar babes and wives,
they cursed their God, and died.</p>

<p>You say of us that we are treacherous, vindictive, and cruel; in answer to
the charge, we declare to all the world with our hands uplifted before high
Heaven, that before the white man came upon us, we were kind, outspoken,
and forgiving. Our real character has been misunderstood because we have
resented the breaking of treaties made with the United States, as we honestly
understood them. The few of our children who are permitted to attend your
schools, in great pride tell us that they read in your own histories, how
William Penn, a Quaker, and a good man, made treaties with nineteen tribes
of Indians, and that neither he nor they ever broke them; and further, that
during seventy years, while Pennsylvania was controlled by the Quakers, not a
drop of blood was shed nor a war-whoop sounded by our people. Your own
historians, and our traditions, show that for nearly two hundred years, different
Eastern powers were striving for the mastery in the new world, and that our
people were persuaded by the different factions to take the war-path, being
generally led by white men who had been discharged from prisons for crimes
committed in the Old World.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_8"></a>[8]</span></p>

<p>Read the following, left on record by Peter Martyr who visited our forefathers
in the day of Columbus.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“It is certain that the land among these people is as common as the sun and water, and
that ‘mine and thine,’ the seed of all misery, have no place with them. They are content
with so little, that in so large a country they have rather a superfluity than a scarceness: so
that they seem to live in the golden world without toil, living in open gardens not intrenched
with dykes, not divided with hedges, nor divided with walls. They deal truly one with another,
without laws, without books, without judges. They take him for an evil and mischievous
man, who taketh pleasure in doing hurt to another, and albeit they delight not in superfluities,
yet they make provision for the increase of such roots whereof they make bread, content
with such simple diet whereof health is preserved and disease is avoided.”</p>
</div>

<p>Your own histories show that Columbus on his first visit to our shores, in a
message to the king and queen of Spain, paid our forefathers this beautiful
tribute:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“They are loving, uncovetous people: so docile in all things that I swear to your majesties
there is not in the world a better race or more delightful country. They love their
neighbors as themselves, and their talk is ever sweet and gentle, accompanied with smiles;
and though they be naked, yet their manners are decorous and praiseworthy.”</p>
</div>

<p>But a few years passed away, and your historians left to be perused with
shame, the following facts:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“On the islands of the Atlantic Coast and in the populous empires of Mexico and Peru,
the Spaniards, through pretense of friendship and religion, gained audience with chiefs and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_9"></a>[9]</span>
kings, their families and attendants. They were received with great kindness and courtesy
but in return they most treacherously seized and bound in chains the unsuspecting natives;
and as a ransom for their release, demanded large sums of gold which were soon given by
their subjects. But instead of granting them freedom as promised, they were put to death in a
most shocking manner. Their subjects were then hunted down like wild beasts, with bloodhounds,
robbed and enslaved; while under pretext to convert them to Christianity, the rack,
the scourge, and the fagot were used. Some were burned alive in their thickets and fastnesses
for refusing to work the mines as slaves.”</p>
</div>

<p>Tradition says these acts of base ingratitude were communicated from tribe
to tribe throughout the continent, and that a universal wail as one voice went
up from all the tribes of the unbroken wilderness: “We must beat back these
strangers from our shores before they seize our lands and homes, or slavery
or death are ours.”</p>

<p>Reader, pause here, close your eyes, shut out from your heart all prejudice
against our race, and honestly consider the above records penned by the pale-faced
historians centuries ago; and tell us in the name of eternal truth, and by
all that is sacred and dear to mankind, was there ever a people without the
slightest reason of offense, more treacherously imprisoned and scourged than
we have been? And tell us, have crime, despotism, violence, and slavery ever
been dealt out in a more wicked manner to crush out life and liberty; or was
ever a people more mortally offended than our forefathers were?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10"></a>[10]</span></p>

<p>Almighty Spirit of humanity, let thy arms of compassion embrace and
shield us from the charge of treachery, vindictiveness, and cruelty, and save
us from further oppression! And may the great chief of the United States
appoint no more broken-down or disappointed politicians as agents to deal
with us, but may he select good men that are tried and true, men who fear
not to do the right. This is our prayer. What would remain for us if we
were not allowed to pray? All else we acknowledge to be in the hands of this
great republic.</p>

<p>It is clear that for years after the discovery of this country, we stood
before the coming strangers, as a block of marble before the sculptor ready
to be shaped into a statue of grace and beauty; but in their greed for gold, the
block was hacked to pieces and destroyed. Child-like we trusted in them
with all our hearts; and as the young nestling while yet blind, swallows each
morsel given by the parent bird, so we drank in all they said. They showed
us the compass that guided them across the trackless deep, and as its needle
swung to and fro only resting to the north, we looked upon it as a thing of
life from the eternal world. We could not understand the lightning and
thunder of their guns, believing they were weapons of the gods; nor could we
fathom their wisdom in knowing and telling us the exact time in which the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11"></a>[11]</span>
sun or moon should be darkened; hence we looked upon them as divine; we
revered them—yes, we trusted in them, as infants trust in the arms of their
mothers.</p>

<p>But again and again was our confidence betrayed, until we were compelled
to know that greed for gold was all the balance-wheel they had. The remnant
of the beasts are now wild and keep beyond the arrow’s reach, the fowls
fly high in air, the fish hide themselves in deep waters. We have been driven
from the homes of our childhood and from the burial places of our kindred
and friends, and scattered far westward into desert places, where multitudes
have died from homesickness, cold, and hunger, and are suffering and dying
still for want of food and blankets.</p>

<p>As the hunted deer close chased all day long, when night comes on, weary
and tired, lies down to rest, mourning for companions of the morning herd,
all scattered, dead, and gone, so we through weary years have tried to find
some place to safely rest. But all in vain! Our throbbing hearts unceasing
say, “The hounds are howling on our tracks.” Our sad history has been
told by weeping parents to their children from generation to generation; and
as the fear of the fox in the duckling is hatched, so the wrongs we have suffered
are transmitted to our children, and they look upon the white man with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12"></a>[12]</span>
distrust as soon as they are born. Hence our worst acts of cruelty should be
viewed by all the world with Christian charity, as being but the echo of bad
treatment dealt out to us.</p>

<p>Therefore we pray our critics everywhere to be not like the thoughtless boy
who condemns the toiling bees wherever found, as vindictive and cruel, because
in robbing their homes he once received the poisoned darts that nature gave
for their defense. Our strongest defense against the onward marching hordes,
we fully realize is as useless as the struggles of a lamb borne high in air,
pierced to its heart, in the talons of the eagle.</p>

<p>We never shall be happy here any more; we gaze into the faces of our
little ones, for smiles of infancy to please, and into the faces of our young men
and maidens, for joys of youth to cheer advancing age, but alas! instead of
smiles of joy we find but looks of sadness there. Then we fully realize in the
anguish of our souls that their young and tender hearts, in keenest sympathy
with ours, have drank in the sorrows we have felt, and their sad faces reflect
it back to us again. No rainbow of promise spans the dark cloud of our afflictions;
no cheering hopes are painted on our midnight sky. We only stand
with folded arms and watch and wait to see the future deal with us no better
than the past. No cheer of sympathy is given us; but in answer to our complaints
we are told the triumphal march of the Eastern race westward is by<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13"></a>[13]</span>
the unalterable decree of nature, termed by them “survival of the fittest.”
And so we stand as upon the sea-shore, chained hand and foot, while the incoming
tide of the great ocean of civilization rises slowly but surely to overwhelm
us.</p>

<p>But a few more generations and the last child of the forest will have passed
into the world beyond—into that kingdom where Tche-ban-yot-booz, the
Great Spirit, dwelleth, who loveth justice and mercy, and hateth evil; who
has declared the “fittest” in his kingdom shall be those alone that hear and
aid his children when they cry, and that love him and keep his commandments.
In that kingdom many of our people in faith believe he will summon
the pale-faced spirits to take position on his left, and the red spirits upon his
right, and that he will say, “Sons and daughters of the forest, your prayers
for deliverance from the iron heel of oppression through centuries past are
recorded in this book now open before me, made from the bark of the white
birch, a tree under which for generations past you have mourned and wept.
On its pages silently has been recorded your sad history. It has touched my
heart with pity and I will have compassion.”</p>

<p>Then turning to his left he will say, “Sons and daughters of the East, all
hear and give heed unto my words. While on Earth I did great and marvelous
things for you—I gave my only Son, who declared unto you my will,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14"></a>[14]</span>
and as you had freely received, to so freely give, and declare the gospel unto
all people. A few of you have kept the faith; and through opposition and
great tribulation have labored hard and honestly for the redemption of mankind
regardless of race or color. To all such I now give divine power to fly
on lightning wings throughout my universe. Now, therefore, listen; and when
the great drum beats, let all try their powers to fly. Only those can rise who
acted well their part on earth to redeem and save the fallen.”</p>

<p>The drum will be sounded, and the innumerable multitude will appear like
some vast sea of wounded birds struggling to rise. We shall behold it, and
shall hear their fluttering as the rumbling of an earthquake, and to our surprise
shall see but a scattering few in triumph rise, and hear their songs re-echo
through the vault of heaven as they sing, “Glory to the highest who
hath redeemed and saved us.”</p>

<p>Then the Great Spirit will speak with a voice of thunder to the remaining
shame-faced multitude: “Hear ye: it is through great mercy that you have
been permitted to enter these happy hunting-grounds. Therefore I charge
you in presence of these red men that you are guilty of having tyrannized over
them in many and strange ways. I find you guilty of having made wanton
wholesale butchery of their game and fish, I find you guilty of using tobacco,
a poisonous weed made only to kill parasites on plants and lice on man and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15"></a>[15]</span>
beast. You found it with the red men, who used it only in smoking the pipe
of peace, to confirm their contracts, in place of a seal. But you multiplied its
use, not only in smoking, but in chewing, snuffing, thus forming unhealthy,
filthy habits, and by cigarettes, the abomination of abominations, learned
little children to hunger and thirst after the father and mother of palsy and
cancers.</p>

<p>“I find you guilty of tagging after the pay agents sent out by the great
chief of the United States, among the Indians, to pay off their birth-right claims
to home, and liberty, and native lands, and then sneaking about their agencies
by deceit and trickery, cheating and robbing them of their money and goods,
thus leaving them poor and naked. I also find you guilty of following the
trail of Christian missionaries into the wilderness among the natives, and when
they had set up my altars, and the great work of redemption had just begun,
and some in faith believed, you then and there most wickedly set up the idol
of man-tchi-man-in-to (the devil), and there stuck out your sign, SAMPLE
ROOMS. You then dealt out to the sons of the forest a most damnable drug,
fitly termed on earth by Christian women, ‘a beverage of hell,’ which destroyed
both body and soul, taking therefore, all their money and blankets, and
scrupling not to take in pawn the Bibles given them by my servants.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16"></a>[16]</span></p>

<p>“Therefore know ye, this much-abused race shall enjoy the liberties of
these happy hunting-grounds, while I teach them my will, which you were in
duty bound to do while on earth. But instead, you blocked up the highway
that led to heaven, that the car of salvation might not pass over. Had you
done your duty, they as well as you would now be rejoicing in glory with my
saints with whom you, fluttering, tried this day in vain to rise. But now I say
unto you, Stand back! you shall not tread upon the heels of my people, nor
tyrannize over them any more. Neither shall you with gatling-gun or otherwise
disturb or break up their prayer-meetings in camp any more. Neither
shall you practice with weapons of lightning and thunder any more. Neither
shall you use tobacco in any shape, way, or manner. Neither shall you
touch, taste, handle, make, buy, or sell anything that can intoxicate any more.
And know ye, ye cannot buy out the law or skulk by justice here; and if any
attempt is made on your part to break these commandments, I shall forthwith
grant these red men of America great power, and delegate them to cast you
out of Paradise, and hurl you headlong through its outer gates into the endless
abyss beneath—far beyond, where darkness meets with light, there to dwell,
and thus shut you out from my presence and the presence of angels and the
light of heaven forever and ever.”</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright

so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project

the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away--you may

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project

other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread

electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
